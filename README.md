### How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?

Using their website and apps they attract users to view postings of homes online. Home viewers produce hundreds of data points that Zillow captures: locations, favorites, tags, price range, interest, times visited, # of visits per listing, etc. Zillow gathers all of this data, and uses it to better understand the market: how much a home costs, what types of people are interested in it, what locations are attracting the most attention, etc. Cross reference that with public data on sold as rates in the same home buying area or network, and it all builds on itself to amplify Zillowâ€™s value prop: more users, attract more listings, more listings create broader access, more data, and more accurate data that attracts more users and more real estate professions. On the other side the Zillow platform is also selling qualified leads, advertising space, CRM services to a range of companies who are in the food chain of home buying: mortgage brokers, agents, etc. Zillow also sells subscription and premier access to highly-sought market data. They are considered a FinTech company because they leveraged technology to 1) develop new home buyer behavior 2) build a competitive advantage unique insights they gained from the data they collected on their platform. It fundamentally changed the industry and made them the top player in home buying and selling and everything in between.

### Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?


Zillow is exemplary because it is one of the first companies that cut out middle-man in real estate transactions. It radically changed the way people buy, sell or rent real estate by crossing information online virtually, matching supply and demand, reducing broker fee in an efficient way. Here are the strengths and weaknesses for this company: 

*Strength*:
Strong brand portfolio Zillow has invested over the years in building and we do see its name has been well spread among current and future users. 
Strong distribution network that Zillow has managed to achieve and reach many potential new markets. 
High level of customer satisfaction the company has dedicated with its customer relationship management. 

*Weakness*: 
Need more investment in new technologies given the scale of the company expansion and different geographies. 
Need government agreement to open up new markets. 
Excessive days inventory compared to the competitors, which can impact long term growth of Zillow.
